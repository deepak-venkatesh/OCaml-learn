(* 

Much easier to read with pattern matching, so much so that I am contemplating making OCaml my primary language ;) 
I am not sure of what all can be done with pattern matching but if functions were much larger I hope we can make things like helper functions
  like we have in Scheme/Common Lisp (I know Lisp a bit). Things like accumulators I already saw in this book.
